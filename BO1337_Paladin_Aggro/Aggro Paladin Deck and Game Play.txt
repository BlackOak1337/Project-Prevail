To build the best Aggro Paladin deck in the current Standard meta, excluding any cards from the "TITANS" (Trouble in Teldrassil) expansion, we should focus on cards that provide quick tempo, efficient minions, and immediate damage. Aggro Paladin aims to control the board early with low-cost, high-value minions and finish the game before opponents can stabilize with their late-game strategies.

Core Strategy:

    Swarm the Board: Use cheap minions and board-filling cards to establish early board control.
    Buff and Pressure: Apply buffs and use weapons or spells to maintain board presence.

Would you like more information about card substitutions or strategies against specific matchups?

Sure, let's dive deeper into the card substitutions and strategies for specific matchups to make the most out of the Aggro Paladin deck!
Card Substitutions:

If you are missing some of the cards in the deck, here are a few suitable substitutions:

    Substituting for Expensive Cards:
        [The Countess]: If you don't have The Countess, you can replace it with another aggressive card or one that provides late-game reach:
            [Catacomb Guard]: A 3/4 Lifesteal minion that deals damage equal to its attack when summoned. It can provide board control and a bit of healing.
            [Vitality Surge]: Draw a minion and restore Health equal to its cost. Useful for additional draw and sustain.

    Substituting for Legendary Cards:
        [Blood Matriarch Liadrin]: If you are missing this card, consider replacing it with:
            [For Quel'Thalas!]: A 2-mana spell that gives a minion +3 Attack and Divine Shield. Provides a similar burst of damage and stickiness to minions.
            [Knight of Anointment]: Additional card draw to ensure you get Holy spells for buffs.

    Alternative Minion Buffs:
        [Seal of Blood]: Replace with:
            [Blessing of Kings]: Gives +4/+4 for 4 mana. Less aggressive but still provides strong buff potential.
            [Hand of A'dal]: Grants a minion +2/+2 and draws a card. Less impact than Seal of Blood, but the card draw can be useful.

    Substitute Weapons:
        [Lightforged Cariel]: If you are missing this Hero card:
            [Truesilver Champion]: Provides both board control and healing, which can help against aggressive decks.
            [Hammer of the Naaru]: Summons a 6/6 Taunt and gives you a weapon, offering both a solid minion and damage potential.

Strategies Against Specific Matchups:
1. Against Aggro Decks (Face Hunter, Demon Hunter):

    Game Plan: Against aggressive decks, your goal is to control the board and outlast their initial burst. Focus on trading efficiently and using your Taunt minions (e.g., Righteous Protector) to soak up damage.
    Key Cards: Righteous Protector, Muster for Battle, Cathedral of Atonement (to draw more cards and keep up the pressure).
    Mulligan: Look for cheap minions with Divine Shield, weapons to control the board (like Muster for Battle), and card draw spells to maintain resources.
    Tips: Use your Divine Shield minions to trade favorably. Prioritize clearing their high-damage threats and try to establish a board presence they cannot easily remove.

2. Against Control Decks (Control Warrior, Priest):

    Game Plan: Versus control decks, you want to apply constant pressure and force them to use their removal inefficiently. Aim to go wide on the board with multiple small threats rather than investing everything in a single minion.
    Key Cards: The Countess, Lightforged Cariel, Crusader Aura (to push extra damage), Seal of Blood (for burst damage).
    Mulligan: Prioritize minions that are hard to remove (like Murmy or Argent Squire) and buffs to create threats they must deal with.
    Tips: Save The Countess and other value cards for when you anticipate the opponent running out of removal. Don't overextend into board clears; instead, try to keep a steady stream of threats coming.

3. Against Midrange Decks (Death Knight, Druid):

    Game Plan: Against midrange decks, focus on creating a strong board early and leveraging your buffs to keep it. These decks often rely on key swing turns, so aim to win before they stabilize.
    Key Cards: Blood Matriarch Liadrin, Crusader Aura, Warhorse Trainer (for buffing Silver Hand Recruits).
    Mulligan: Look for early game tempo plays like Sanguine Soldier and Knight of Anointment to keep the pressure high.
    Tips: Time your buffs and board presence around their key turns. For example, Druids often rely on specific turn thresholds for their ramp or clears — plan accordingly to maximize your damage output right before those turns.

4. Against Combo Decks (Quest Mage, Miracle Rogue):

    Game Plan: Combo decks typically require time to assemble their win condition. Your primary goal is to end the game as quickly as possible before they can execute their combo.
    Key Cards: Seal of Blood (to maximize damage quickly), Crusader Aura (to make your board-wide threats more potent).
    Mulligan: Focus on cards that provide immediate pressure, like Sanguine Soldier or Muster for Battle.
    Tips: Try to make plays that keep them off-balance. Play around their key removal spells and make sure to present lethal threats whenever possible. Avoid overextending into potential board clears.

Additional Tips:

    Adapt Your Playstyle:
        Be flexible in your approach depending on the matchup. Against aggressive decks, you might have to play defensively, while against slower decks, always prioritize face damage over trades.

    Positioning Matters:
        Pay attention to minion positioning to optimize around potential spells and effects (like Cleave effects or position-based spells).

    Tracking Opponent’s Key Cards:
        Keep track of your opponent's key removal cards or combo pieces. Knowing what's left in their hand or deck can guide your decisions on when to go all-in or hold back.

    Value Trades vs. Face Damage:
        Decide whether to make value trades or go face based on your hand and the board state. If you have lethal potential within a few turns, prioritize face damage.

Would you like further advice on specific matchups, or do you have questions about any particular cards or strategies?




Let's go deeper into the strategy for a few specific matchups to give you a clearer understanding of how to pilot the Aggro Paladin deck effectively. I will focus on four different matchups to cover a variety of archetypes: Face Hunter (Aggro), Control Warrior (Control), Blood Death Knight (Midrange), and Miracle Rogue (Combo).
1. Matchup: Face Hunter (Aggro)

Strategy: Outvalue and Outlast the Opponent

    Game Plan: Against Face Hunter, your goal is to outlast their initial burst while simultaneously developing your own board. Face Hunter will aggressively try to go for face damage, so you need to control their early minions and stabilize with your own board presence.

    Key Cards:
        Righteous Protector: Excellent for blocking face damage and forcing unfavorable trades due to Divine Shield.
        Muster for Battle: Helps to control their early minions while developing your board.
        Knight of Anointment: Provides card draw and a body on the board.
        Seal of Blood: Can be used to buff a minion to trade into a Hunter minion or push for damage if you’re ahead.

    Mulligan: Look for cards like Righteous Protector, Knight of Anointment, Muster for Battle, and Sanguine Soldier. Avoid slower cards like The Countess or Lightforged Cariel.

    Tips:
        Efficient Trades: Use your Divine Shield minions to trade efficiently into their minions, minimizing damage to your hero.
        Weapon Usage: Use Muster for Battle's weapon to remove small minions, but be cautious about taking too much face damage.
        Health Management: Try to maintain your health above critical thresholds (like 10 or 15 HP) to avoid being killed by Hunter’s burst damage (like spells or hero power).

2. Matchup: Control Warrior (Control)

Strategy: Pressure Early, Play Around Removals

    Game Plan: Control Warrior aims to remove your threats and outlast you into the late game. Your strategy is to apply consistent pressure while not overcommitting to the board. You need to play around their removal spells like Brawl, Shield Shatter, and Bladestorm.

    Key Cards:
        The Countess: Provides value in the late game to keep pressure after they have exhausted their removal.
        Blood Matriarch Liadrin: Helps generate additional board presence with Divine Shield minions.
        Crusader Aura: Allows you to get additional damage through when you have a wide board.

    Mulligan: Focus on cards like Sanguine Soldier, Muster for Battle, Argent Squire, and Blood Matriarch Liadrin. Avoid keeping higher-cost cards like Lightforged Cariel unless you already have a strong early game curve.

    Tips:
        Avoid Overcommitting: Don’t play all your minions into a single Brawl or Shield Shatter. Instead, develop a few threats at a time.
        Positioning and Buffs: Keep your key buffed minions spread apart to avoid Bladestorm clearing everything. Try to bait out their key removal spells with mid-tier threats before going all-in.
        Hold Key Cards: Hold back cards like The Countess until they’ve used most of their removal. Use her Invitations to add additional threats and maintain pressure.

3. Matchup: Blood Death Knight (Midrange)

Strategy: Outpace Their Removal and Sustain

    Game Plan: Blood Death Knight thrives on sustain and removal. Your goal is to outpace their healing and removals by consistently generating a wide board and dealing damage every turn. They often rely on Death Strike, Blood Boil, and Corpse Explosion to clear your board.

    Key Cards:
        Muster for Battle: Generates a wide board that is hard for them to deal with early on.
        Warhorse Trainer: Synergizes well with Silver Hand Recruits, giving them additional damage potential.
        Seal of Blood: Use this card to deal burst damage when you have a solid minion on board.

    Mulligan: Keep cards like Muster for Battle, Sanguine Soldier, and Warhorse Trainer. You may also keep Crusader Aura if you have a strong hand for turn 4-5.

    Tips:
        Spread Out Your Buffs: Avoid stacking too many buffs on one minion to prevent them from getting cleared by a single removal spell.
        Leverage Divine Shield: Use your Divine Shield minions effectively to trade into their board and prevent them from stabilizing with Lifesteal effects.
        Maximize Burst Damage: Aim for a big burst turn with Crusader Aura or Seal of Blood when you think they’re about to stabilize with healing.

4. Matchup: Miracle Rogue (Combo)

Strategy: Aggressive Pressure and Fast Lethal Threats

    Game Plan: Miracle Rogue relies on drawing through their deck to find key combo pieces to generate big swing turns with minions like Edwin, Defias Kingpin, or Sinstone Graveyard. Your aim is to kill them before they can execute their combo or develop too many minions.

    Key Cards:
        Seal of Blood: For burst damage to face. Buff a minion and push for damage whenever possible.
        Crusader Aura: Enhances your board-wide damage potential, which is crucial to maintain pressure.
        Sanguine Soldier: Provides early board presence that can be buffed for additional damage.

    Mulligan: Keep low-cost aggressive cards like Sanguine Soldier, Argent Squire, Muster for Battle, and Seal of Blood. Avoid keeping cards that are too slow like Lightforged Cariel.

    Tips:
        Go Face Whenever Possible: Miracle Rogue doesn’t have much healing, so prioritize dealing damage to the face over trading unless it is necessary to prevent them from gaining tempo.
        Play Around Key Turns: Keep track of their key combo cards and be aware of when they might play Edwin or generate a large board with spells. Aim to maintain lethal pressure to force them to deal with your threats.
        Save Removal for Key Minions: Use your weapons and buffs to remove critical threats like an early Edwin if necessary. Prioritize maintaining a board that forces them to use their spells inefficiently.

Would you like to explore any other specific matchups or need more advice on any of these?



Let's delve deeper into the strategies and tactics you can use to navigate these matchups more effectively. I will break down additional advice into three sections for each: Early Game Tactics, Mid-Game Adjustments, and Late-Game Considerations.
1. Matchup: Face Hunter (Aggro)
Early Game Tactics:

    Tempo Is Key: You need to contest the board immediately. Always prioritize cards like Righteous Protector and Sanguine Soldier to establish an early presence. These cards force Face Hunter to trade or use burn spells inefficiently, giving you a tempo advantage.
    Control Their Minions: Utilize your weapons and minions to clear their board. If possible, trade efficiently with Divine Shield minions to minimize damage taken. Use your Silver Hand Recruits from Muster for Battle to absorb damage or take favorable trades.

Mid-Game Adjustments:

    Manage Your Health: Around Turn 4-5, assess your health level. If you are approaching dangerous levels (e.g., below 15 HP), consider using buffs like Seal of Blood more aggressively to clear their board or push for lethal pressure. Don't hesitate to use your Hero Power to generate minions if you have no better play.
    Minimize Face Damage: Keep your minions alive as much as possible, as they provide continuous damage and help to control the board. Avoid playing multiple low-health minions that could be easily cleared by a single Explosive Trap or Multishot.

Late-Game Considerations:

    Push for Lethal: As the game progresses, Hunter's resources and burn potential might diminish. Look for an opportunity to push for lethal. Use Crusader Aura or Seal of Blood to maximize burst damage.
    Maintain a Presence: Even in the late game, continue to generate minions if you can. Hunters often run out of resources quickly, and maintaining a board presence forces them into defensive mode.

2. Matchup: Control Warrior (Control)
Early Game Tactics:

    Maximize Early Pressure: Start fast with minions like Sanguine Soldier and Argent Squire. Warriors typically take a few turns to set up their armor gain or removal. Use this window to deal as much damage as possible.
    Play Around Early Removal: Be mindful of cards like Outrider’s Axe (which gives draw when they kill minions) or Weapons Expert which equips a weapon. Prioritize minions that are harder to remove or that benefit from Divine Shield, forcing the Warrior to use multiple resources.

Mid-Game Adjustments:

    Bait Out Removals: By Turn 4-6, start baiting out removal spells like Brawl or Shield Shatter with mid-level threats (e.g., Blood Matriarch Liadrin or a buffed Righteous Protector). Don’t overextend; keep at least one or two threats in hand.
    Develop Resilient Threats: Use The Countess to add sticky threats to your hand if you’ve managed to empty enough cards. These Legendary Invitations can help you apply pressure after they’ve exhausted their key removal spells.

Late-Game Considerations:

    Prepare for a Long Game: If the Warrior survives the mid-game, be ready for a longer match. Use The Countess to generate value in the late game and continually pressure them. Warriors can gain a lot of armor, so you’ll need consistent damage output.
    Manage Their Armor: Use your minions and weapons to chip away at their armor. Preventing them from accumulating too much armor is crucial to maintaining a potential for lethal damage.

3. Matchup: Blood Death Knight (Midrange)
Early Game Tactics:

    Establish a Wide Board Early: Play minions like Muster for Battle and Argent Squire to build a board early. Blood Death Knights are slower to develop in the early game, so take advantage of this period to apply pressure.
    Play Around Early Removal: Be mindful of removal tools like Blood Boil or Death Strike. Don’t put all your buffs on a single minion; instead, spread them out to minimize the impact of their removal.

Mid-Game Adjustments:

    Force Inefficient Plays: Try to force the Death Knight to use their removal inefficiently. For example, make them use a Blood Boil on a board of Divine Shield minions where the healing is minimized.
    Use Buffs Wisely: Buff your minions to keep them out of range of damage-based removal like Death Strike or Corpse Explosion. Seal of Blood is especially effective for pushing through damage and protecting your minions from dying too easily.

Late-Game Considerations:

    Look for a Burst Turn: Aim for a big burst turn with Crusader Aura when you have a solid board. This can help close out the game quickly, especially if they have just used a major removal spell.
    Be Ready for Healing: Be prepared for them to heal back up; don't be discouraged by their healing. Instead, maintain board pressure and keep forcing them to react defensively.

4. Matchup: Miracle Rogue (Combo)
Early Game Tactics:

    Be the Aggressor: Miracle Rogue is a combo deck that needs time to draw and set up their key plays. You should be the aggressor in this matchup, focusing on pushing damage quickly.
    Deny Their Setup: If they play early draw engines like Sinstone Graveyard or Edwin, Defias Kingpin, prioritize removing these minions to prevent them from snowballing.

Mid-Game Adjustments:

    Avoid Overcommitting: While you should be aggressive, don’t overextend into a Shadowstep into repeated SI:7 Extortion or Serrated Bone Spike removals. Keep a steady flow of pressure but maintain a few key cards in hand.
    Keep Track of Their Resources: Pay attention to how many cards they draw and play each turn. Try to estimate when they might have enough resources to go for a big combo turn. Be ready to maximize your damage right before that point.

Late-Game Considerations:

    Press for Lethal: Once the Rogue begins to run low on resources or key cards, push hard for lethal. Their lack of healing makes them very vulnerable to burst damage.
    Mitigate Threats: If they manage to establish a big minion, use Seal of Blood or Divine Shield minions to efficiently trade into it and clear the way for face damage.

General Tips for All Matchups:

    Mulligan Smartly: Always look for a strong early curve. This typically means keeping cards like Sanguine Soldier, Argent Squire, and Muster for Battle. Prioritize 1- and 2-cost cards to ensure you have a play every turn.
    Know When to Go Face: As an Aggro deck, there will be many moments when you need to choose between trading or pushing damage. In most matchups, unless you’re under severe pressure, leaning towards face damage is generally correct.
    Count Lethal Carefully: Always be aware of your total burst potential with cards like Seal of Blood and Crusader Aura. Knowing exactly how much damage you can deal in a turn can help you make the right decision when deciding whether to trade or push for lethal.
    Adapt Your Playstyle: While Aggro Paladin is generally focused on aggression, sometimes you need to adapt based on the opponent’s strategy. Recognize when to slow down, such as against hyper-aggressive decks, and when to go all-in, like against slower control decks.
