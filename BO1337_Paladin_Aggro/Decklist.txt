To play your Hyper-Aggro Paladin deck effectively, you'll want to maximize your strengths in each phase of the game — early, mid, and late — to apply constant pressure and control the board. Here's a detailed breakdown of the best playstyle for each phase:
Early Game (Turns 1-3)

Objective: Establish board presence and maintain tempo.

    Mulligan Priority: Focus on low-cost, high-value minions like Murmy, Righteous Protector, and Gold Panner. You want to fill the board quickly to overwhelm your opponent.
    Key Plays:
        Turn 1: Play Murmy or Righteous Protector. These cards are sticky due to their Reborn or Divine Shield effects, helping you maintain early board presence.
        Turn 2: Drop Gold Panner to start drawing extra cards or play Hi Ho Silverwing for additional pressure and card cycling.
        Turn 3: Consider Muster for Battle to summon multiple minions and gain a weapon, which can help control the board or push face damage.
    Strategy:
        Go wide on the board early with multiple low-cost minions.
        Use Divine Shield minions to protect against early removal spells.
        Apply pressure directly to the opponent's face or use your minions to trade efficiently, maintaining control of the board.

Mid Game (Turns 4-7)

Objective: Sustain aggression and reinforce your board presence.

    Key Plays:
        Turn 4-5: Use Crusader Aura to buff your minions when attacking, increasing their survivability and damage output. Flash Sale can provide additional minions and a stat buff to existing ones.
        Turn 4: Play Boogie Down to summon more 1-cost minions from your deck, further establishing a wide board presence.
        Turn 5: Use Toy Captain Tarim to equalize and neutralize large threats by setting the stats of a problematic enemy minion to match Tarim’s 3/7 body.
        Turn 6: Horn of the Windlord can help deal with large enemy minions or push substantial face damage.
        Turn 7: Amitus, the Peacekeeper can protect your board from AoE effects or enable your minions to trade more favorably.
    Strategy:
        Maintain your board presence by playing additional minions and using spells or minions to buff them.
        Utilize Showdown! to summon multiple minions with Rush, allowing you to remove threats and keep up pressure.
        Look for opportunities to use your minions efficiently, either pushing face damage or trading against your opponent’s threats.
        Keep in mind that you may need to anticipate and play around your opponent’s potential AoE spells.

Late Game (Turns 8+)

Objective: Close out the game with your remaining threats and finishers.

    Key Plays:
        Turn 8: Prismatic Beam can clear a wide enemy board if necessary, but ideally, you want to avoid needing it by keeping pressure up throughout the game.
        Turn 10: Sea Giant is a great finisher if there are many minions on the board, either your own or the opponent's.
        Late Turns: Use Horn of the Windlord strategically for its Windfury effect to deal significant face damage over two attacks, potentially closing out the game.
        Zilliax Deluxe 3000 and its modules (like Pylon Module and Ticking Module) can provide you with healing, survivability, and additional board presence if the game goes longer than expected.
    Strategy:
        Leverage any remaining buffs and your powerful finishers to close out the game.
        Use Sea Giant to take advantage of a cluttered board and overwhelm your opponent with a large minion.
        Zilliax Deluxe 3000 should be used to maintain board presence and provide some last-minute healing or protection.

General Tips

    Maintain Board Presence: Always aim to have a wide board, as your deck relies on overwhelming the opponent with minions.
    Tempo and Aggression: Focus on tempo by playing multiple minions or minions with impactful abilities each turn.
    Play Around AoE: Be aware of common AoE spells from your opponent's class and try not to overcommit if you suspect a board wipe.
    Push Face Damage: When you have established enough board control, prioritize pushing face damage over trading, especially if you can set up a 2-3 turn lethal.

By sticking to these strategies, you can maximize the effectiveness of your Hyper-Aggro Paladin deck and maintain pressure throughout the game, increasing your chances of securing a win.
